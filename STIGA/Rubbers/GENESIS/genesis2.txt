GENESIS S TABLE TENNIS RUBBER

STIGA Genesis combines the best of the major table tennis cultures into one rubber. It has a potent synthesis of Japanese/STIGA developed OCS-technology, Swedish knowledge, and a new spin elastic top sheet made in China. Members of the Chinese and Swedish natinal teams collaborated to create the ultimate balance between east and west. The new top sheet is substainably developed to increase the durability and lifetime of the rubber. The oxygen Capsule System in the sponge generates an intense catapult effect and speed.

The soft sponge provides a high sound with incredible spin.
Made in China rubber with European characteristic spin elastic feel.
The OCS-technology provides the rubber with enough catapult effect to keep pressure during long rallies from mid distance.
