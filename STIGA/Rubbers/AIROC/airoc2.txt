AIROC M TABLE TENNIS RUBBER

STIGA Airoc M utilizes our OCS sponge technology (Oxygen Capsule System) to increase catapult effect without changing the spin ratio. This allows aggressive players to maintain the same spin/speed proportions they have always enjoyed. The key to this evolutionary advancement is the delicate balance between the size of the air pockets within the sponge and the elasticity of the top sheet. STIGA¡¦s engineers tested many different pip designs and tensions to achieve the perfect rubber for the attacking player.
