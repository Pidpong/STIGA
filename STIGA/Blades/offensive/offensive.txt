ARCTIC WOOD TABLE TENNIS BLADE

Arctic Wood is what you get when you combine nature and science. A blade born in nature and crafted by our knowledge and experience. For this blade we have found a rare pale outer veneer which only grows in the cold and deep forests above the arctic circle. This, together with our well-renowned VPS (Veneer Precision System) in the second layer, results in a unique blade with characteristics like no other.

Stiff offensive 5-ply blade with characteristics like no other.
Unique pale outer veneer with rustic feeling.
Special temperature treated middle veneers (VPS) reduce vibration and give great stability.
Perfect combination of nature and science.
