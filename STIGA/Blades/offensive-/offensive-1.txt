CELERO WOOD TABLE TENNIS BLADE

In the Celero Wood we introduce a harder second layer compared to our previous wood series. This second layer has a very high density which generates more power in offensive strokes. The combination between the high density second layer and the soft surface creates a unique blade with excellent feeling and great hitting power. This blade is perfect for the players with a controlled offensive style of play.
