CARBONADO 290 TABLE TENNIS BLADE

With the Carbonado blades we have taken the carbon blade manufacturing to a new level by using the made in Sweden carbon technology known as TeXtremeR. The blades are built with five layers of wood and two layers of lightweight TeXtremeR Spread Tow Carbon fibers. This unique and patented carbon is the first of its kind and has never before been experienced in Table Tennis.

Very offensive 5+2-ply blade.
Carbonado 290 is constructed with carbon layers in a 90 degree angle.
90 degree angle provides flexural bendability, giving the blade a stiff feel with great stability and high speed.
The high trajectory makes it a perfect choice for the offensive player who looks for good speed and stability combined with excellent control.
200 gram carbon fibre per m2. A thicker TeXtremeR carbon fibre for increased power and carbon feel.
High personalized sweet spot.
