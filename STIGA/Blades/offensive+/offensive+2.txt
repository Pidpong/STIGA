CARBONADO 190 TABLE TENNIS BLADE

With the Carbonado blades we have taken the carbon blade manufacturing to a new level by using the made in Sweden carbon technology known as TeXtremeR. The blades are built with five layers of wood and two layers of lightweight TeXtremeR Spread Tow Carbon fibers. This unique and patented carbon is the first of its kind and has never before been experienced in Table Tennis.

Very offensive 5+2-ply blade
Carbonado 190 is constructed with Carbon layers in a 90 degree angle.
90 degree angle provides flexural bendability, giving the blade a stiff feel with great stability and high speed.
The longer and flatter trajectory makes it an excellent choice for players who want to command the gameplay with high speed strokes.
100 gram carbon fibre per m2. The original amount of TeXtremeR carbon fibre for the perfect balance between wood and carbon feel.
High personalized sweet spot.
