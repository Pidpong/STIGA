CARBONADO 245 TABLE TENNIS BLADE

With the Carbonado blades we have taken the carbon blade manufacturing to a new level by using the made in Sweden carbon technology known as TeXtremeR. The blades are built with five layers of wood and two layers of lightweight TeXtremeR Spread Tow Carbon fibers. This unique and patented carbon is the first of its kind and has never before been experienced in Table Tennis.

Very offensive 5+2-ply blade.
Carbonado 245 is constructed with carbon layers in a 45 degree angle.
45 degree angle provides torsional bendability, giving the blade more flexibility and increased stiffness.
The longer and flatter trajectory makes it an excellent choice for players who want to command the gameplay with high speed strokes.
200 gram carbon fibre per m2. A thicker TeXtremeR carbon fibre for increased power and carbon feel.
Wide personalized sweet spot.
