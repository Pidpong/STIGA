CARBONADO 145 TABLE TENNIS BLADE

With the Carbonado blades we have taken the carbon blade manufacturing to a new level by using the made in Sweden carbon technology known as TeXtremeR. The blades are built with five layers of wood and two layers of lightweight TeXtremeR Spread Tow Carbon fibers. This unique and patented carbon is the first of its kind and has never before been experienced in Table Tennis.

Very offensive 5+2-ply blade
Carbonado 145 is constructed with Carbon layers in a 45 degree angle.
45 degree angle provides torsional bendability, giving the blade more flexibility and increased stiffness.
The high trajectory makes it a perfect choice for the offensive player who looks for good speed and stability combined with excellent control.
100 gram carbon fibre per m2. The original amount of TeXtremeR carbon fibre for the perfect balance between wood and carbon feel.
Wide personalized sweet spot.
